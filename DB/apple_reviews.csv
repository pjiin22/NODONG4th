You get to work with some of the nicest people on earth—supportive, encouraging, and always willing to help.

Training is thorough, focusing on customer connection over hard sales, which suits tech enthusiasts who love problem-solving. The downside? It’s relentless—high customer volumes, especially during launches, mean you’re always on. Management can be hit-or-miss; some are supportive, others micromanage or push metrics over experience. Growth opportunities exist but can feel stagnant in retail roles. It’s ideal for students or those craving a dynamic gig, but the chaotic pace and occasional entitled customers test your patience.

If you're motivated, a self-starter, open to feedback, and always strive to be better, you'll do really well here. Apple has amazing benefits (especially for retail). I used some of these benefits me to get me the skills to move to a job out of retail.

There are opportunities to grow. Career experiences can be huge once you've been there for awhile. Every store is a little different. Each have their own personality. For stores that are in a city of their own, it can be hard to move up, because people will get to a position they like and park.

In cities with more stores, there's more opportunities (but also more competition).

I enjoyed the people I work with. Most of my managers were too numbers driven (and that seems to be a trend since Covid). It feels less like the ""Ritz Carlton"" treatment, and more the ""sell sell sell!""

Customers have been a little more mean since Covid... But it can be incredibly rewarding when you change someone's life!",,,,,,,

Some of the perks that Apple offer are the best specially for a retail company.

The time keeping - numbers driven - and career development are very poor at the company!! Sadly this is going worse and worse over the years as is increasingly difficult to progress within the company.

Compared to other retail jobs there are more benefits to working for Apple vs others. The base pay and benefits are slightly above average for retail, but this is because there is no commission or bonuses. After being with Apple for 9 years, I wish there was a commission or bonuses structure because there’s very little incentive to perform.

Going for a new job role hinges entirely on the interview, they try to remain completely unbiased and don’t take your behaviours (good or bad) into account during interviews. There are people in positions in my store who REALLY should not be there because they do not exemplify good customer service, work ethic, product knowledge or willingness to improve, but they covered the points in the interview and that’s all that matters.

This is very discouraging to apply to new roles. Also along with the being no monetary incentives for performance and the base pay being above average makes it difficult to leave.

2024년 11월 1일,3,Analyst (전 직원),Singapore,"Stay away from this company, The Titanic has started its journey from Southampton Port towards NY en-route the Iceberg.","What is the best part of working at the company?
Good perks, salary, stock options, decent work-life balance.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Dealing with people from higher management who have stayed in Apple far too long and regular employees with low emotional quotient. Company is like sun and other technology centre other than Cupertino are like planets or satellites. They will never allow people from other centers to excel even if they have talents or want to exceed.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
It depends on the team and the manager. Most of the teams and members try to justify their existence. Apple is a big company with a fat budget so happily carries them over. So you can imagine the work culture and environment, to say the environment is toxic and culture has gone to dogs will be an understatement.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
A typical day for most analysts would spend 50% of the time in useless meetings with no or minimum outcomes, the rest 20% the time talking about Apple products and showing off to their colleagues, discussing about their managers, their past travelogue, and future ones, discussing how to close their rings in their Apple watch, etc, food (favorite though), rest 30% doing a bit of work, although the majority of them just act as if they are quite busy.

Sure, this can be said about any place, but in this particular place all of the major ideas and executions come from Cupertino, California, and not your coworker so when someone ask you your opinion on how to go about something, they are simply looking for your input and they have already decided on the strategy that they’ll be moving forward with.

Decent health coverage and benefits that extend to spouses, dependents and even domestic partners. In corporate functions, 3 days in office and 2 days WFH. Nice offices (though locations in AMK and One North aren't very central) and generally you feel like you're in a very 'adult' corporate work environment.

There are plenty of cons too, and exeperience will vary wildly depending on the organisation/function you're in. There's the usual toxic workplace politics -- some worse than others. There are some great senior leadership, but middle management is generally a cesspool. If you're hoping for a highly fun, energetic and collaborative culture, pick your organisation wisely.

When I first started I was told you would be part of the family and looked after. I was so excited but nervous at the same time. For the first maybe 7 or 8 weeks things were amazing. Then they took a turn.

I started to notice that there were groups of people. Clicks as it were and if you were not in this group, you would be spoken about.

Someone who started with me got on very well with a lead. This was nice but as time moved on a few people noticed that this member received special treatment. For example, rather than serving customers, they could tidy the shop to avoid customers. I was tasked to work with this colleague and a lot of the time they went out the back for a drink or a toilet break. At the end of the day, we were both praised for our hard work. I had also finished a lot more work which this colleague took credit for. I do enjoy working as part of a team but when the team decide they will come to work to chill out, it makes it harder to deal with.

After a few months, I was offered a chance to go for a role. There were two positions open and the colleague in question said he did not prepare for this interview and had no experience there. I've done this kind of work before but I was shot out. This colleague managed to get a third position that opened up out of nowhere. It was a good thing because after speaking to the colleague they explained to me how they didn't like customers. Another colleague was told he wasn't allowed to go for the role as there were too many men in the bar -

As a job seeker, I've seen the same job recycled over and over with no real updates, while employers complain about being flooded with unqualified applicants. It feels like management is more concerned with profit than improving the platform’s functionality. Their customer service is unhelpful, slow, and often dismisses concerns, which shows how little they value their users.
